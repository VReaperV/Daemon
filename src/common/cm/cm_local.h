// a facet is a subdivided element of a patch approximation or model, used for collisions
// It's basically a 2-dimensional degenerate brush. Like a brush, it encompasses a region
// defined by bounding planes, but surfacePlane and borderPlanes[numBorders-1] are always the
// same except with opposite normals. So the region is a convex polygon on the surface plane.
//
// There is a difference with how it is treated compared to brushes - a trace that hits the
// "back" side can pass through without colliding. This detail usually doesn't matter much,
// but the idea may be to make the patch surface (approximated by one or more facets), in the
// case that the facets enclose some space and form a complete "object",
// behave as a whole more similarly to a brush, in that a trace that starts
// overlapping and ends completely outside does not hit anything. However, a patch surface
// is still different from a brush in that the interior is not solid. The design of making
// the inward-facing plane non-collidable makes the trace API a bit less semantically
// consistent since a trace starting in the interior and ending outside will say that the
// path is completely free, while reversing the direction will hit something.
//
// For nonzero-length traces, a facet that overlaps the start position is always completely ignored.
// Thus it is impossible to get the startsolid or allsolid flags from a patch. But for a zero-length
// trace, a patch does set allsolid. So there is some inconsistency between the zero- and nonzero-
// length cases.
//
// A few mappers have exploited the patch back-side behavior to construct one-way doors. These
// consist of a planar patch that is converted to a single facet. Players can pass into the patch
// (and then move freely due to the overlap behavior) from one side, but not the other.

// keep 1/8 unit away to keep the position valid before network snapping

// FIXME: it seems like the way this is used just makes brushes 0.1 unit bigger and does not
// actually fix numerical stability. For example in PM_GroundTrace(), a trace against the
// ground the player is standing on frequently has a spurious startsolid=true. What we would
// want is for traces to stop 0.1 unit away from the world (as they do now), but for the
// startsolid flag *not* to be set when there is something 0.1 unit away.
// TODO: find out why this happens and see if it might affect patches at well. Since
// a movement trace that starts inside a patch always ignores the patch completely,
// this might allow going through patches when it shouldn't be possible.
